**Notes:**

Day 1 is about HTML. Day 2 is about CSS.

Day 3 and Day 4 is about git and github.

Day 5 is creating a personal website. I already hosted it in m4rk00s.github.io

Thereâ€™s a group project, still not hosted yet on GitHub Pages, but you can check the repo: https://github.com/m4rk00s/hacktiv8-ecommerce
